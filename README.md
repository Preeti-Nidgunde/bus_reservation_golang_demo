Bus Reservation System (Demo Project)

  This Bus Reservation System was created as a demo project to showcase my Golang skills, particularly focusing on REST API development and database functionality. I built 
this project within a short time frame after realizing that Dubai recruiters often look for GitHub projects in a candidate's portfolio.

Project Overview
Implements REST APIs for booking and managing bus reservations.
Demonstrates structured database integration in Golang.
Follows a layered architecture for maintainability and scalability.

Project Structural layers:
db - Handles database operations and queries.
bl - Implements core business logic for the system.
endpoints - Defines REST API endpoints for user interactions.
models - Represents data models and database mappings.

This project is a technical demonstration of my ability to structure and implement backend systems efficiently.
